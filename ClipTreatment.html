            You can remove them easily, clean them and put them back in the mouth yourself without any dentist visits. Every two weeks or as per the schedule, you will get a new set of invis-aligners to replace the old one. In this manner, the treatment is continued as long as required to correct your orthodontic defects. The treatment with Invisalign may take longer in some cases as they are used to align teeth in stages.</p>

            <b>Clean your teeth:</b> If your teeth are not properly cleaned, your dentist may have to clean them before cementing and fixing the dental braces. Cleaning your teeth prior to orthodontist visit will speed up the treatment process. If you have a history of dental problems in the past, regular professional dental cleaning is highly recommended. At MaxiDent Dental Hospital, we do professional cleaning all around the year. Book an appointment anytime.<br>
            <b>Expect some discomfort:</b>
            Depending on the type of braces used, you may or not experience discomfort. However, we recommend taking the medication provided in the prescription properly until your mouth adjusts to the changes. Eat soft food during the first week or 3 days and drink non-sugary fluids.<br>
            Sometimes, tooth extraction may be required for fitting braces as required, in such cases, additional medications and instructions are to be followed carefully to void any discomfort.</p>
